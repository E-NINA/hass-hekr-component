## Contribution

If you found yourself using Wisen application with any of your Smart Home devices, contact me via
e-mail <alryaz@xavux.com>. The process of adding new devices is not yet completely formalized,
the milestone is set for a release-candidate version.

Check original repository with HekrAPI bindings: [hekrapi-python: Hekr protocol bindings for Python](https://github.com/alryaz/hekrapi-python)

## Example configuration

### Power meter protocol: `power_meter`
```yaml
- platform: hekr
  host: home-power-meter.lan
  device_id: ESP_2M_AABBCCDDEEFF
  control_key: 202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70
  protocol: power_meter
```

In this state, the plugin will generate three sensors, all obtained via a single `queryDev` command.
These sensors are:
- `status` - **Status** (whether device reports any kind of errors)
- `current_consumption` - **Current Consumption** (current power consumption in *W*)
- `total_consumption` - **Total Consumption** (total energy consumption in *kW*).

Also the following sensors are available, but not enabled by default (as they increase the amount of requests required to poll the device, leading to infrequent, but possible timeouts):

- `voltage` - **Voltage** (voltage for every available phase, also mean voltage)
- `current` - **Current** (current for every available phase, also mean current)
- `power_factor` - **Power Factor**
- `active_power` - **Active Power**
- `reactive_power` - **Reactive Power** 

#### Custom sensors, polling interval and name
```yaml
- platform: hekr
  host: home-power-meter.lan
  device_id: ESP_2M_AABBCCDDEEFF
  control_key: 202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70
  scan_interval:
    seconds: 15
  protocol: power_meter
  sensors:
    - status
    - current_consumption
    - total_consumption
    - voltage
    - current
    - power_factor
    - active_power
    - reactive_power
```
